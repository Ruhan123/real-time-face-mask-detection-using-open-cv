# real-time-face-mask-detection-using-open-cv
Face Mask Detection system built with OpenCV, Keras/TensorFlow using Deep Learning and Computer Vision concepts 
in order to detect face masks in static images as well as in real-time video streams.

application uses-:
This system can be used in real-time applications which require face-mask detection for safety purposes due to the outbreak of Covid-19.
This project can be integrated with embedded systems for application in airports, railway stations, offices, schools, and 
public places to ensure that public safety guidelines are followed.


we used important library  as follows-
1 OpenCV
2 Keras
3 TensorFlow
4 matplotlib 
5 numpy
